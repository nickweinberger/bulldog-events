**Running the Code**
To run the code, download the file submitted called "final" change into the directory "final" and execute "flask run." Click the link that appears. It will
take you to the home page of our website, Yale Events.

**Homepage**
On the homepage, as with all other pages, there exists a navbar which includes the title of our project, Yale Events, as well as list items Sports, Acapella,
Comedy, Theater, and Add Events. Click these links to go to the various pages of our website, on which you can search through Sports events, Acapella events,
Comedy events, Theater events and add your own events. On the right side of the navbar are options to register or log in, but more on that later. Below the
navbar is a dates dropdown button and a search bar. By default, you search through all events regardless of date, but the dates dropdown bar allows you to
filter for events that are either just today or only in the future. By clicking the search button, you can execute a search through all of our databases
(Sports, Acapella, Theater, Comedy) at once. The events that match your search content will appear below in a stylized “card” form with a photo added by the
user as well as information about each event such as date, time, location, description, etc.

**Sports, Acapella, Theater, Comedy**
If you click the “Sports” option in the navbar from the homepage, or any other page for that matter, it will take you to the Sports page. The sports page is
similar to the homepage in appearance (it extends the same layout) and function. On the Sports page, the search bar only allows you to search for events
within the “Sports” table of our main “Events” database. The Acapella, Theater, and Comedy pages all function in the same way. On each page, the search bar
only searches through the relevant database to find events.

**Add Events, Register & Login**
If you click on the “Add Events” link in the navbar, you will be redirected to a login page. Only users with accounts will be able to add events
to our database, and later on, we plan on giving this option to leaders of sports teams, and comedy, acapella, theater groups, etc. so they can add
their own events. If you do not yet have an account, click the "here" link. This will redirect
you to our registration page, which requires you to enter a confirmation password and to meet certain password requirements. Once you are logged in,
(or registered) you will be redirected to the Add Events page. At this point, the options to login/register will have become an option to logout, which
you can use to change accounts if, say, your friend wants to add some of her events as well. Instead of a search bar, this page includes several forms
designed to allow you to easily input all the necessary information about your event, including an image of your choosing that will appear next to your
event.
